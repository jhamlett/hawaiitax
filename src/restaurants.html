        <p class="editable">HiAccounting has been serving one of the local franchise owners of Teddy’s for many years. We work with our client
        on providing him with accurate and timely financials and tax preparation services. We use technology to streamline
        processes, separate income in locations in Wahiawa and Kapi’olani, and provide constant analysis of cost of sales.
        And when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, HiAccounting was by their side helping them navigate the complex benefits
        provided by the government – helping with PPP loans and other government assistance. HiAccounting helped
        Teddy’s when they needed it the most. Let us help your restaurant as well!</p>
