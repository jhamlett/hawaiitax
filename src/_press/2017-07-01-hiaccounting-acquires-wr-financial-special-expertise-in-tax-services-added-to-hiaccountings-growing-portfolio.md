> <br>“It is a wonderful fit, as WR Financial is primarily a tax firm with some accounting services, and HiAccounting has been to date primarily focused on accounting and advisory services, with some tax work,” said Matthew Delaney, President of both HiAccounting and The Hawaii Group. “When we merge the two businesses together, the result will be approximately 2/3 accounting and advisory services and 1/3 tax services.”

HiAccounting is purchasing the assets of WR Financial. The four full-time employees will all be hired by HiAccounting. The Owner and President, Janet Williams-Reyes, CPA/PFS, will continue in a leadership role at HiAccounting as Director of Tax Services.

This means HiAccounting’s areas of expertise and ability to serve its clients just increased dramatically. HiAccounting currently provides services to 50 unique clients and has served 112 unique clients since its inception in 2009. HiAccounting had twelve employees before the acquisition, of which 5 are CPAs.
