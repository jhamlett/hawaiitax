[Hawaii Accounting LLC](http://hi-accounting.com) (HiAccounting), a division of [The Hawaii Group](https://thehawaiigroup.com/) (HiGroup), has been recognized by *[Accounting Today](http://accountingtoday.com)&nbsp;*as one of the Best Accounting Firms to Work For in 2020. This award marks the first time HiAccounting has been recognized on a national basis.

[*Accounting Today*’s](http://accountingtoday.com) annual survey and awards program, conducted in partnership with Best Companies Group, identifies and honors firms that have excelled in creating engaging, quality workplaces for their employees. HiAccounting is one of 100 companies from across the United States featured in this year’s list.

“This recognition truly speaks to the care and attention we’ve put into building our Ohana at HiAccounting and The Hawaii Group as a whole,” said HiAccounting and HiGroup CEO [Matt Delaney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-delaney-a49b731/). “Our culture and work environment are a direct reflection of our team and I am incredibly proud to be among so many other quality firms.”

Firms recognized in the 2020 Best Accounting Firms to Work For list were evaluated in a two-part survey process. The first part assessed each nominated company’s workplace policies, practices, philosophy, systems and demographics as factors in contributing to a positive work environment, while the second part consisted of an employee survey that measured employees’ experiences and input. These evaluations were scored and analyzed to result in an overall ranking of the 100 best accounting firms.

The official ranking and in-depth report on the 2020 class of firms will be released by [*Accounting Today*](http://accountingtoday.com) online at [AccountingToday.com](http://accountingtoday.com) and in their print edition this September.
