<p>Hawaii Employment Services, Inc (HiEmployment) and its parent company, The Hawaii Group, will sponsor a blood drive on Friday, January 31st from 7:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. The blood drive will be held at the Topa Financial Center in Conference Rooms 301 and 302. This drive comes at critical time when the downtown blood bank donation site, previously located across the street, recently closed its doors. As a result, the Blood Bank expects strong turnout from the business community.</p>
<p>Spearheading this drive is Sean Knox, President of HiEmployment. A steady donor himself since 1999, Knox believes the effort is vital to supporting the Hawaii community. &ldquo;You never know when you or someone you love may need an additional blood supply,&rdquo; stated Knox, who still donates whenever he can. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to imagine how grateful you would be to those who helped save your life. This is one simple way we can all really make a difference and help others without even opening our wallets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>HiEmployment has worked hard to hardwire the spirit of giving into its culture, giving employees credit for volunteering and giving back to the community.</p><strong>Call (808) 848-4770 for more information and to schedule your blood donation.</strong>
