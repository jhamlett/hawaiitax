<p>Matt Delaney and Scott Meichtry, owners of The Hawaii Group, have been interviewed and featured in the <em>Pacific Business News</em> regarding the company&rsquo;s expansion to the mainland and the way our business will be evolving to accommodate the change.</p>
<p><em>Delaney said the national expansion will also give the companies the ability to leverage each others&rsquo; back offices, and said it will be helpful to have staff working in different time zones available to clients.<br>
<br>
Despite the plans for national expansion, Delaney said he is not shifting his focus out of Hawaii.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking to continue with our rapid growth here in Hawaii in 2014, on all the islands,&ldquo; Delaney said, adding that Hawaii remains the priority, and is the engine that will help to fuel future opportunities.</em></p>
