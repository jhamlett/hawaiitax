Matt Delaney, president and chief executive officer of The Hawaii Group, has plans to expand the professional employer organization’s accounting service, HiAccounting.

Delaney, who is back from California to head the Honolulu-based company after taking a two-year hiatus, told Pacific Business News he will be taking on the role of president of HiAccounting in addition to his duties as president and CEO of the company, whose subsidiaries include HiEmployment, HiNursing, HiHomeCare and HiHealthcare.

Scott Meichtry, who co-founded the company with Delaney in 2009, left the role in August to take some time off after stepping in to be the company’s chairman, president and CEO in 2014, during Delaney’s absence.

“We’re looking to expand with more tax services and advisory services,” Delaney said, adding that the company plans to close on a number of acquisitions within the next 60 days. “These acquisitions will provide added members to our team.”.
