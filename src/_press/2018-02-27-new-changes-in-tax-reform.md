##### Business

1. C Corporation
   * Tax Rates: 21% flat rate. Fiscal year-end taxpayers use a blended rate. 2017 Rates Max 35%
     * Note that for most small business taxpayers, the choice of a S corporation or Partnership will continue to be a desirable entity choice (of course, various factors to consider). This is primarily due to the new Passthrough Deduction – see below.
   * Corporate AMT repealed.
   * DRD (dividends received deduction): Change in overall rates depending on ownership.
   * Net operating losses: Carryforward allowed indefinitely but limited to 80% of taxable income. Carrybacks are no longer allowed. Previously, carryback and carryforward of NOL was allowed to offset taxable income with no limitations.
2. New Passthrough Deduction: New Section 199A deduction allowed for Qualified Business Income for Noncorporate taxpayers. Max potential is a 20% deduction off of taxable income – shortening the gap between individual passthrough rates and the new corporate tax rates. Special rules for service businesses and thresholds are based on W2 wages, qualified property and 20% of taxable income. Many details are involved – see rules for more information.
3. Business interest deduction: Limited to the sum of 30% of adjusted taxable income. Other special rules apply. Previously, no limitations on business interest deductions.
4. Domestic production activities deduction (DPAD S. 199): The DPAD is repealed. Previously, taxpayers participating in manufacturing/producing activities in the US were given a 9% deduction based on taxable income from those activities.

   * Exempt from percentage of completion method for long term contracts expected to be completed within two years.
6. Bonus Depreciation: 100% deduction for qualified property acquired and placed in service after 9/27/17. Qualified property includes new and used property. Previously, deduction was only 50% and property had to be brand new.
7. Improvement Property: The classifications qualified leasehold improvement, qualified restaurant, and qualified retail improvement property are eliminated. One category will replace the previously used multiple classifications - Qualified Improvement Property (QIP).
   * Useful life 39 years
   * Technical correction may be made by Service to change life from 39 years to 15 years.
   * Not eligible for bonus depreciation
8. Section 179: Deduction increased to $1M with phaseout limitation of $2.5M. Previously, 179 was $510K with a $2.030M phaseout.

     * QIP (with 39 year life).

  <p>Business Planning Ideas:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Accelerate deductions to 2017 and defer revenue to 2018. Consider change in accounting method for method of accounting (cash), inventory, accrued liabilities, deferred revenue, cost segregation or depreciation.</li>
    <li>Meals, Entertainment, and Parking: Evaluate company policy to see if any changes should be made.</li>
    <li>Entity Choice: For most passthrough businesses (S co &amp; Partnership), coverting to a C corporation will not significantly decrease or alter taxes. However, the decision to change how an entity is taxed must be made on a business by business case - considering the long term objectives of the business, size of the entity and parties involved.</li>
