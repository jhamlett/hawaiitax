The Hawaii Group Named one of Hawaii’s Best Places to Work for the Seventh Year in a Row!

The Hawaii Group (HiGroup) is honored to be one of Hawaii’s Best Places to Work for seven years in a row! HiGroup received the award on March 30 at an event hosted by Hawaii Business Magazine at Hilton Hawaiian Village.

Founded in 2009, HiGroup’s rapid growth can be attributed to not just exemplary professional services but also to its pervasive ‘ohana culture, which extends to clients and employees alike. Throughout HiEmployment (temporary and permanent placement), HiAccounting (accounting), and HiNursing (medical facility and homecare staffing) each individual is treated like family.

Since its inception, the HiGroup team has enjoyed exceptional benefit packages. Alongside traditional options, such as full medical, dental, vision, drug, disability, life insurance, 401K, and profit sharing, as well as a generous PTO and holiday leave program, The Hawaii Group also proudly offers its employees even more generous support at work, at home, and in the community. Offering paid time off for employees to volunteer as well as investing in learning and development opportunities company-wide, HiGroup enthusiastically encourages their team members’ desires to be good citizens on and off the job.

The aim is to provide a healthy balance in life, says Matthew Delaney, CEO. "An average person spends 1/3 to 1/2 of their day/week at work. We try to give some of those hours back with our flexible work hours." And when things might get out of balance over the course of a career? "We offer a sabbatical, where our employees take six weeks to recharge, develop, and recommit."

With regular lunches for staff in all offices (Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Hawaii Island), monthly birthday celebrations, fitness reimbursements, parking and regular in-office massage therapy, HiGroup has fostered a healthy, happy and entirely unique daily experience for their employees.

"Our business will thrive if our employees flourish,” says Delaney. It seems that philosophy is proving effective—year after year!
