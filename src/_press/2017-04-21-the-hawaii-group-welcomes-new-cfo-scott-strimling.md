The Hawaii Group has named Scott A. Strimling Chief Financial Officer. In the past two and a half decades, Strimling has proven himself to be an astute financial executive with success in all facets of accounting and financial management. As a Certified Public Accountant, Strimling is adept at streamlining financial process, enhancing productivity levels, and introducing process improvements.

Strimling comes to The Hawaii Group from California-based digital courseware company Toolwire Inc., where he served as Vice President of Finance. Strimling provided leadership to the finance organization and management team in all aspects of accounting, cash management, financial planning and analysis, and budgeting. In his career at Toolwire, he was able to align the company's expenses consistent with a product pivot resulting in savings of ~$200K per month.

“I am looking forward to Scott joining the team and bringing his financial experience to our various companies,” said Matt Delaney, President and CEO. “Scott and I met in college at the University of Southern California twenty-seven years ago when we pledged our fraternity together as well as studied accounting and business together. So not only do I think he’s an asset for The Hawaii Group, his being here adds an extra sense of ‘ohana to the company.”

“The Hawaii Group is a dynamic company,” said Strimling. “The environment is both challenging and exciting because of its rapid growth. I’m looking forward to helping shape the company in the years ahead.”

Strimling has worked as a consultant for The Hawaii Group and its various subsidiaries over the last 6 months, and started full time on April 1st.

The Hawaii Group was recently named as one of Hawaii’s “Best Places to Work” for the 7th year in a row. It has been also recognized as one of the Top 250 companies in the state of Hawaii again for 2016.
