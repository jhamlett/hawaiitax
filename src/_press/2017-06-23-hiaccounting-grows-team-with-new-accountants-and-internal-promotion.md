<br>**Ellie Zhao** started as an Accounting Intern with HiAccounting in 2013, and has been on the rise ever since. “She is an amazing asset to the company,” says Delaney. In 2014 Zhao was hired full-time as Accounts Payable Clerk. A few months later, she was promoted to Senior Accounts Payable Clerk. In 2016 she was promoted to Accountant. With the recent promotion, she is now Senior Accountant and has taken on more responsibility.

“Our talented team reflects both the diversity of Hawaii and the diverse needs of our clients,” said Scott Strimling, Chief Financial Officer. “We are pleased that HiAccounting’s growth is on track for another record-setting year, and that the team we are building has such depth of talent.”
