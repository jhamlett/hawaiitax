<p>Proving more formidable than ever, The Hawaii Group has again commenced aggressive renovations at its expanded location. With a newly signed lease on an additional space adjoining its existing ground floor offices, the company announces that it is following through on its stated commitment to sustainable growth and improved capacity to service its clients. As part of the substantial renovations underway, the company plans to connect the two suites, effectively converting the space into one substantial office that will occupy the majority of the mauka wing of the ground floor of the Fort Street Tower in the Topa Financial Center.</p>
<p>Located at 745 Fort Street in downtown Honolulu, the Topa Financial Center welcomes the new expansion, where The Hawaii Group first joined on as a new tenant back in July 2013. Combining Suites 116 and 124 creates a new office space that will house The Hawaii Group&rsquo;s rapidly growing divisions.</p>
