Sheri Miyashiro, CPA, returns to Hawaii to assume the Tax Senior position at HiAccounting. Born and raised on the North Shore, the Kamehameha Schools graduate returns from nine years accounting and tax work in San Francisco. She was a Tax Senior Associate at Grant Thornton LLP, the fifth largest international accounting firm in the world, and before that a Client Accountant at Hoffman Lewis. In between her undergraduate and graduate degrees, she worked here on Oahu for The Madden Corporation for 2 ½ years.  Miyashiro is a tax professional experienced working with various entity types in federal and state tax compliance, with a focus in partnerships and corporations.

“She brings a wealth of knowledge and experience from her international tax firm experience,” said HiAccounting President Matt Delaney, “which makes her a great asset for our team. Grant Thornton was my father’s old firm, so the family connection is an added plus.”

Miyashiro has a Bachelor’s in Business Administration from the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and a Master of Science in Accountancy from San Francisco State University.

“It’s wonderful to be home to raise my own family here,” says Miyashiro, “and to have the opportunity to continue to grow professionally at such an innovative company. What excited me most about HiAccounting and The Hawaii Group is the work-life balance that is embedded in the company culture and the great team that they have put together.”

“We are excited to welcome Sheri and her wealth of tax knowledge to our team.  Our clients will benefit greatly as we start our year-end tax planning,” stated Janet Williams-Reyes, Director of Tax Services for HiAccounting.

Sheri Miyashiro started with HiAccounting on September 5th.
