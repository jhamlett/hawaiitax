        <h4>QBI Deduction</h4>
        <p class="editable">If you operate a pass-through business such as a proprietorship, partnership, or S corporation, new tax code Section
        199A offers you a possible 20 percent tax deduction on your business income.</p>
        <p class="editable">The gift applies only for tax years 2018 through 2025.</p>
        <p class="editable">You will be able to obtain this business income gift if your 2018 taxable income is equal to or less than $315,000
        (married, filing jointly) or $157,000 (filing as single or head of household).</p>
        <p class="editable">When you are under the thresholds above, you find your deduction by applying the 20 percent to the lesser of your
        defined qualified business income (QBI), or taxable income less defined capital gains (IRS Clarifies Net Capital Gains
        in Final 199A Regulations).</p>
        <p class="editable"><em>Example:</em> If you have defined QBI of $100,000 and taxable income of $120,000 with no capital gains, your Section 199A
        gift is a deduction of $20,000 (20 percent of $100,000). If you can qualify, you will enjoy this tax-deduction gift.
        After all, what’s not to love? So, let’s get started and see what makes up your QBI.</p>
        <h4 class="pt-4">Establish Your IRA Before the 2020 Year-End</h4>
        <p class="editable">If you plan on contributing to a Standard or Roth IRA for the 2020 tax year, make sure that you establish an IRA account
        before December 31, 2020. If you do, you will be able to make a 2020 contribution until April 15th, 2021.</p>

          Business <span class="text-gray">| Tax Considerations</span>
        </h2>
        <p class="editable">
          Here are <strong>seven</strong> powerful business tax-deduction strategies that you can easily understand and implement before the end of
          2020:
        </p>
        <h4>Prepay Expenses Using the IRS Safe Harbor</h4>
        <p class="editable">IRS regulations contain a safe-harbor rule that allows <em>cash-basis taxpayers</em> to prepay and deduct qualifying expenses up
        to 12 months in advance without challenge, adjustment, or change by the IRS.</p>
        <p class="editable">For a <em>cash-basis taxpayer</em>, qualifying expenses include lease payments on business vehicles, rent payments on offices and
        machinery, and business and malpractice insurance premiums.</p>
        <p class="editable"><em>Example:</em> You pay $3,000 a month in rent and would like a $36,000 deduction this year. So on Thursday, December 31, 2020,
        you mail a rent check for $36,000 to cover all of your 2021 rent. Your landlord does not receive the payment in the mail
        until Tuesday, January 5, 2021. Here are the results:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You deduct $36,000 in 2020 (the year you paid the money).</li>
          <li>The landlord reports taxable income of $36,000 in 2021 (the year he received the money).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="pt-4">Stop Billing Customers, Clients, and Patients</h4>
        <p class="editable">Here is one rock-solid, time-tested, easy strategy to reduce your taxable income for this year: stop billing your
        customers, clients, and patients until after December 31, 2020. (We assume here that you or your corporation is on a
        cash basis and operates on the calendar year.) Customers, clients, patients, and insurance companies generally don’t pay
        until billed. Not billing customers and patients is a time-tested tax-planning strategy that business owners have used
        successfully for years.</p>
        <p class="editable"></p>
        <h4 class="pt-4">Buy Office Equipment</h4>
        <p class="editable">With bonus depreciation now at 100 percent along with increased limits for Section 179 expensing, buy your equipment or
        machinery and place it in service before December 31, and get a deduction for 100 percent of the cost in 2020.
        Qualifying bonus depreciation and Section 179 purchases include new and used personal property such as machinery,
        equipment, computers, desks, chairs, and other furniture (and certain qualifying vehicles).</p>
        <h4 class="pt-4">Use Your Credit Cards</h4>
        <p class="editable">If you are a single-member LLC or sole proprietor filing Schedule C for your business, the day you charge a purchase to
        your business or personal credit card is the day you deduct the expense. Therefore, as a Schedule C taxpayer, you should
        consider using your credit card for last-minute purchases of office supplies and other business necessities.</p>
        <p class="editable">If you operate your business as a corporation, and if the corporation has a credit card in the corporate name, the same
        rule applies: the date of charge is the date of deduction for the corporation.</p>
        <p class="editable">But if you operate your business as a corporation and you are the personal owner of the credit card, the corporation
        must reimburse you if you want the corporation to realize the tax deduction, and that happens on the date of
        reimbursement. Thus, submit your expense report and have your corporation make its reimbursements to you before midnight
        on December 31.</p>
        <h4 class="pt-4">Don’t Assume You Are Taking Too Many Deductions</h4>
        <p class="editable">If your business deductions exceed your business income, you have a tax loss for the year. With a few modifications to
        the loss, tax law calls this a “net operating loss,” or NOL.</p>
        <p class="editable">If you are just starting your business, you could very possibly have an NOL. You could have a loss year even with an
        ongoing, successful business.</p>
        <p class="editable">You used to be able to carry back your NOL two years and get immediate tax refunds from prior years; however, the Tax
        Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) eliminated this provision. Now, you can only carry your NOL forward, and it can only offset up
        to 80 percent of your taxable income in any one future year.</p>
        <p class="editable">What does all this mean? You should never stop documenting your deductions, and you should always claim all your
        rightful deductions. We have spoken with too many business owners, especially new owners, who do not claim all their
        deductions when those deductions would produce a tax loss.
</p>
        <h4 class="pt-4">Turn NOLs into cash for your business</h4>
        <p class="editable">There’s little to be grateful for with COVID-19, but one of the several exceptions is the potential opportunity to turn
        NOLs into cash for your business.</p>
        <p class="editable">Two NOL opportunities come from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The CARES Act allows NOLs arising in tax years beginning in 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be carried back five years for
          refunds against prior taxes.</li>
          <li>Before the CARES Act, you could not carry back your 2018, 2019, or 2020 losses, and your NOL could offset only up to 80
          percent of taxable income before your Section 199A deduction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="editable">Before the CARES Act, you could not carry back your 2018, 2019, or 2020 losses, and your NOL could offset only up to 80
        percent of taxable income before your Section 199A deduction.</p>
        <h4 class="pt-4">Deal with Your Qualified Improvement Property</h4>
        <p class="editable">In the CARES Act, Congress finally fixed the qualified improvement property (QIP) error that it made in the TCJA. QIP is
        any improvement made by the taxpayer to the interior portion of a building that is non-residential real property (think
        office buildings, retail stores, and shopping centers) if you place the improvement in service after the date you place
        the building in service.</p>
        <p class="editable">If you have such property on an already filed 2018 or 2019 return, it’s on that return as 39-year property. You now must
        change it to 15-year property, eligible for both bonus depreciation and Section 179 <em></em>expensing</em>.</p>
        <h4 class="pt-4">Health Insurance for >2% S-Corp Shareholders</h4>
        <p class="editable">If you pay for health insurance through, or are reimbursed by your S Corporation, the correct tax reporting for any
        shareholder that owns more than 2% of the company is to include the health insurance paid on their 2020 Form W-2 in
        Boxes 1 & 16 and Box 14. The health insurance payments are not subject to payroll taxes. All you need to do is inform
        whoever prepares your payroll that the corporation paid $XX amount of health insurance for the shareholder. The payroll
        service should know what that means and should then include the amounts on the shareholder’s W-2, as appropriate, added
        to wages reported in Boxes 1 & 16, with the amount of health insurance also reported in Box 14. If this is not done, the
        IRS position is that health insurance will be treated as an itemized deduction subject to a 7.5% of AGI limitation.
        (Please make sure the payroll is done correctly to include the health insurance premiums for >2% Shareholders on their
        2020 Form W-2).</p>
        <h4 class="pt-4">Personal Use of Company Car (PUCC)</h4>
        <p class="editable">If you reimburse yourself for auto mileage from your company, then read no further on this subject, as what follows will
        not apply to you. However, if your corporation pays for all your automobile expenses, you are required to include the
        PUCC fringe benefit amount in your W-2. It is considered taxable income to you subject to payroll taxes, and it will
        also appear in Box 14. Including this fringe benefit allows you to write-off all auto expenses on the business. The
        calculation for this fringe benefit is not terribly complicated – all you need to know is the approximate value of the
        auto when it was placed in service, and the number of miles driven during 2020 – both personal and total mileage for the
        year. We have attached a worksheet and table that will allow you to make this calculation. An alternative calculation is
        to use the “commuting value method” which is to include $3/day as compensation, or $780 for the year. Including PUCC in
        your W-2 will show that you are complying with the fringe benefit rules, and if this does apply to you, we recommend you
        include the appropriate amount on your W-2. If you require assistance with this calculation, please call, we’ll be happy
        to help. Otherwise, inform your payroll service of the PUCC fringe benefit that should be included on your 2020 W-2.
        Alternatively, you can reimburse the company for the amount of personal use and not include any amount as a fringe
        benefit.</p>
        <h4 class="pt-4">Reimburse Yourself!!</h4>
        <p class="editable">Please be sure to reimburse yourself for expenses that you may have paid on behalf of the corporation during the year.
        Related expenses may include travel, business meals and mileage, supplies, home office expenses, dues and subscriptions,
        etc. The reason it’s important to do this is so that the expenses are captured and deducted in full at the corporate
        level. Otherwise you may be leaving deductible expenses on the table, because if you try to deduct them as employee
        business expenses on your individual return, they are considered miscellaneous itemized deductions and are no longer
        deductible for federal tax purposes. We suggest that you use the attached Excel template to organize and help document
        your expense reimbursement, and then all you have left to do is cut yourself a check or offset prior distributions you
        may have already made to yourself.</p>
