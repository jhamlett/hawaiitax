## Overview

The CARES Act, which was passed into law to help stimulate the economy, authorized 2 rounds of stimulus payments (also known as Economic Impact Payments or EIPs) that were issued to many taxpayers.&nbsp; These payments are treated as advance tax credits against your 2020 income taxes.&nbsp; For this reason, in order to avoid potential errors when claiming the advance tax credit, it’s imperative that we know the amount of stimulus payments you received.&nbsp;**Not having this accurate information will result in subsequent and preventable correspondence from the IRS**.&nbsp; This is where we need your help.&nbsp;

Recipients of these economic impact payments should have received an IRS Notice 1444, notifying them of the amount of payment(s) they should have received.&nbsp; If you haven’t already, please forward this notice to our office as we will need it in order to complete your 2020 return.&nbsp; If you do not recall receiving this notice, or did not keep it for your records, we ask that you go to the following website:&nbsp;

[https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments){: target="_blank"}

**Please do the following:**

* Log in via the “Get My Payment” link.&nbsp;
* When prompted please enter your social security number, date of birth, and street address reported on your 2018 or 2019 return.
* Once you get through the login, the status of your EIP(s) will appear.&nbsp; If payment was made it will indicate date paid and bank account details.&nbsp;
* Please review your bank account activity for referenced payment. &nbsp;When you locate the EIP deposit, please print out or screenshot the information and upload to your secure client portal.

**No one wants a follow-up letter from the IRS proposing changes to their tax return**, and this is clearly what we are hoping to avoid.&nbsp; Thank you in advance for your assistance with this matter.
