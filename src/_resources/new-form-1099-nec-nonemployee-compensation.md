<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Form 1099-NEC (Nonemployee Compensation) is a new tax form that businesses will be required to file. Form 1099-NEC replaces Box 7 on Form 1099-MISC to report nonemployee compensation which reflects payments to nonemployee service providers and vendors. This change reflects only a change in reporting and not a change in the rules regarding payment filing requirements.</p>

<h2>Nonemployee Compensation</h2>
<p>Starting in 2020, payments for services made in the course of a trade or business to US persons will be reported on Form 1099-NEC. Note that Form 1099-MISC still will report other payment types such as rent, other income, and royalties. However, the IRS has rearranged the box numbers for reporting certain income on Form 1099-MISC.</p>
<h2>Examples of Nonemployee Compensation</h2>
<p>Business taxpayers must file a Form 1099-NEC form for nonemployee compensation if all four of these conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is made to someone who is not your employee,</li>
  <li>It is made for services in the course of your trade or business,</li>
  <li>It was made to an individual, partnership, estate, or corporation (with exceptions), and</li>
  <li>The payments made to the payee were at least $600 or more for the year.</li>
</ul>
