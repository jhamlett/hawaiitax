### *Dear Client,*

**Individual, C Corporation and Trust/Estate&nbsp;**federal tax returns are due on&nbsp;**April 15th**.&nbsp; If we do not receive your tax documents by&nbsp;**March 18th**, it may become necessary to apply for an extension of time to file.&nbsp; Note that an extension of time to file is not an extension of time to pay.&nbsp; All taxes owed are due by the original filing due date.&nbsp;

Note that we may recommend an extension to file for those impacted by the new COVID-19 tax laws and relief as we await additional guidance from the state of Hawaii. &nbsp;Timing of Hawaiiâ€™s announcement may impact the timing of your tax return filings.

Please contact a member of our tax team at&nbsp;***808\.529.9990*&nbsp;**so that we can discuss your options.
