### ​​​​​​**Overview**

The Internal Revenue Service has started sending letters to more than 36 million American families who, based on tax returns filed with the agency, may be eligible to receive monthly&nbsp;**Child Tax Credit&nbsp;**payments starting in July.

The expanded and newly-advanceable Child Tax Credit was authorized by the&nbsp;**American Rescue Plan Act**, enacted in March. The letters are going to families who may be eligible based on information they included in either their&nbsp;*2019*&nbsp;*or*&nbsp;*2020 federal income tax return.*

Families who are eligible for advance Child Tax Credit payments will receive a second, personalized letter listing an estimate of their monthly payment, which begins&nbsp;**July 15th**.

### &nbsp;

### **Who Is Eligible?**

The new maximum credit is available to taxpayers with a&nbsp;*modified adjusted gross income (AGI)*&nbsp;of:

* **$150,000**&nbsp;or less for&nbsp;**married couples filing a joint return**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**qualified widows**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**widowers**.

### &nbsp;

### **Next Steps**

Most families do not need to take any action to get their payment. Normally, the IRS will calculate the payment amount based on the&nbsp;*2020 tax return*.&nbsp; If that return is not available, either because it has not yet been filed or it has not yet been processed, the IRS will instead determine the payment amount using the&nbsp;*2019 return*.

Eligible families will begin receiving advance payments, either by direct deposit or check. The payment will be up to&nbsp;**$300 per month**&nbsp;for each qualifying child under age 6 and up to&nbsp;**$250 per month**&nbsp;for each qualifying child ages 6 to 17.

### &nbsp;

### **Payment Dates**

The IRS will issue advance Child Tax Credit payments on the following dates:

* July 15th&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
* August 13th&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
* September 15th&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
* October 15th&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
* November 15th&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
* December 15th

&nbsp;

### **Eligible Families Should File Tax Returns Soon**

The IRS urges individuals and families who haven’t yet filed their&nbsp;*2020 return*&nbsp;– or&nbsp;*2019 return*&nbsp;– to do so as soon as possible so they can receive any advance payment they’re eligible for.
