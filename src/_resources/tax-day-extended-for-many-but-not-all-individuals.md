### ***What Should You Know?***

**Here is what the postponement means for individuals:**

**1\.&nbsp; &nbsp;**Individual taxpayers can postpone federal income tax payments for the&nbsp;**2020&nbsp;****tax year**&nbsp;due on&nbsp;*April 15, 2021*, to&nbsp;*May 17, 2021*, without penalties and interest. Penalties and interest will begin to accrue on any remaining unpaid balances as of*&nbsp;May 17, 2021*.

**2\.**&nbsp; &nbsp;Individual taxpayers who need additional time to file beyond the&nbsp;*May 17*&nbsp;deadline can request a filing extension until&nbsp;*Oct. 15*. Taxpayers should pay their federal income tax due by&nbsp;*May 17, 2021*,&nbsp;**to avoid interest and penalties**.

**3\.&nbsp; &nbsp;**This relief does not apply to estimated tax payments that are due on&nbsp;*April 15, 2021*. These payments are still due on&nbsp;*April 15*.
