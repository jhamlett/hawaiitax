<p><strong>Individual, C Corporation and Trust/Estate </strong>federal tax returns are due on <strong>April 15th</strong>.  If we do not receive your tax documents by <strong>March 18th</strong>, it may become necessary to apply for an extension of time to file.  Note that an extension of time to file is not an extension of time to pay.  All taxes owed are due by the original filing due date. </p>

<p>Note that we may recommend an extension to file for those impacted by the new COVID-19 tax laws and relief as we await additional guidance from the state of Hawaii.  Timing of Hawaii’s announcement may impact the timing of your tax return filings.</p>

<p>Please contact a member of our tax team at <strong><em>808.529.9990</em> </strong>so that we can discuss your options.</p>
