<p>The Internal Revenue Service has started sending letters to more than 36 million American families who, based on tax returns filed with the agency, may be eligible to receive monthlyÂ <strong>Child Tax CreditÂ </strong>payments starting in July.</p>

<p>The expanded and newly-advanceable Child Tax Credit was authorized by theÂ <strong>American Rescue Plan Act</strong>, enacted in March. The letters are going to families who may be eligible based on information they included in either theirÂ <em>2019</em>Â <em>or</em>Â <em>2020 federal income tax return.</em></p>

<p>Families who are eligible for advance Child Tax Credit payments will receive a second, personalized letter listing an estimate of their monthly payment, which beginsÂ <strong>July 15th</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-eligible"><strong>Who Is Eligible?</strong></h3>

<p>The new maximum credit is available to taxpayers with aÂ <em>modified adjusted gross income (AGI)</em>Â of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>$150,000</strong>Â or less forÂ <strong>married couples filing a joint return</strong>Â andÂ <strong>qualified widows</strong>Â andÂ <strong>widowers</strong>.</li>

<p>Most families do not need to take any action to get their payment. Normally, the IRS will calculate the payment amount based on theÂ <em>2020 tax return</em>.Â  If that return is not available, either because it has not yet been filed or it has not yet been processed, the IRS will instead determine the payment amount using theÂ <em>2019 return</em>.</p>

<p>Eligible families will begin receiving advance payments, either by direct deposit or check. The payment will be up toÂ <strong>$300 per month</strong>Â for each qualifying child under age 6 and up toÂ <strong>$250 per month</strong>Â for each qualifying child ages 6 to 17.</p>
