<h3 id="american-opportunity-tax-credit-aotc">American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)</h3>

<p>In its most basic form, the exclusion works like so: The AOTC is the sum of 100 percent of the first $2,000 of qualified tuition and related expenses paid by the taxpayer for an eligible student, plus 25 percent of the next $2,000 of qualified expenses paid. The credit amount phases out ratably for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) between $80,000 and $90,000 ($160,000 and $180,000 for joint filers).</p>

<p>The lifetime learning credit is equal to 20 percent of the qualified tuition and related expenses paid by the taxpayer during the tax year on the first $10,000 of tuition.The allowable credit is reduced if the taxpayer has MAGI above certain thresholds. The phaseout begins for single taxpayers in 2018 when MAGI reaches $57,000 ($58,000 for 2019). The phaseout begins for married individuals filing jointly in 2018 when MAGI reaches $114,000 ($116,000 for 2019).</p>
