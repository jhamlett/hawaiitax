<ol>
  <li>C Corporation
    <ul>
      <li>Tax Rates: 21% flat rate. Fiscal year-end taxpayers use a blended rate. 2017 Rates Max 35%
        <ul>
          <li>Note that for most small business taxpayers, the choice of a S corporation or Partnership will continue to be a desirable entity choice (of course, various factors to consider). This is primarily due to the new Passthrough Deduction â€“ see below.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Corporate AMT repealed.</li>
      <li>DRD (dividends received deduction): Change in overall rates depending on ownership.</li>
      <li>Net operating losses: Carryforward allowed indefinitely but limited to 80% of taxable income. Carrybacks are no longer allowed. Previously, carryback and carryforward of NOL was allowed to offset taxable income with no limitations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Passthrough Deduction: New Section 199A deduction allowed for Qualified Business Income for Noncorporate taxpayers. Max potential is a 20% deduction off of taxable income â€“ shortening the gap between individual passthrough rates and the new corporate tax rates. Special rules for service businesses and thresholds are based on W2 wages, qualified property and 20% of taxable income. Many details are involved â€“ see rules for more information.</li>
  <li>Business interest deduction: Limited to the sum of 30% of adjusted taxable income. Other special rules apply. Previously, no limitations on business interest deductions.</li>
  <li>Domestic production activities deduction (DPAD S. 199): The DPAD is repealed. Previously, taxpayers participating in manufacturing/producing activities in the US were given a 9% deduction based on taxable income from those activities.</li>
  <li>Methods of accounting: New exceptions that are applicable to businesses with average 3 years gross receipts of $25M or less. Previously, these rules did not exist.
    <ul>
      <li>Cash method</li>
      <li>Exempt from maintaining inventories</li>
      <li>Exempt from UNICAP (S. 263A)</li>
      <li>Exempt from percentage of completion method for long term contracts expected to be completed within two years.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bonus Depreciation: 100% deduction for qualified property acquired and placed in service after 9/27/17. Qualified property includes new and used property. Previously, deduction was only 50% and property had to be brand new.</li>
  <li>Improvement Property: The classifications qualified leasehold improvement, qualified restaurant, and qualified retail improvement property are eliminated. One category will replace the previously used multiple classifications - Qualified Improvement Property (QIP).
    <ul>
      <li>Useful life 39 years</li>
      <li>Technical correction may be made by Service to change life from 39 years to 15 years.</li>
      <li>Not eligible for bonus depreciation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Section 179: Deduction increased to $1M with phaseout limitation of $2.5M. Previously, 179 was $510K with a $2.030M phaseout.
    <ul>
      <li>S. 179 now applies to
        <ul class="section-list">
          <li>QIP (with 39 year life).</li>
          <li>Nonresidential real property improvements such as roofs, HVACs, fire protection, alarm systems and security systems.</li>
        </ul>

  <li>Like kind exchange: Now limited to only transactions in real property. Previously, other tangible property qualified (i.e. vehicles, equipment).</li>
  <li>International tax law: Various changes for businesses doing business internationally including a new one-time repatriation tax.</li>
</ol>

<div class="sub-section">
  <p>Business Planning Ideas:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Accelerate deductions to 2017 and defer revenue to 2018. Consider change in accounting method for method of accounting (cash), inventory, accrued liabilities, deferred revenue, cost segregation or depreciation.</li>
    <li>Meals, Entertainment, and Parking: Evaluate company policy to see if any changes should be made.</li>
    <li>Entity Choice: For most passthrough businesses (S co &amp; Partnership), coverting to a C corporation will not significantly decrease or alter taxes. However, the decision to change how an entity is taxed must be made on a business by business case - considering the long term objectives of the business, size of the entity and parties involved.</li>
