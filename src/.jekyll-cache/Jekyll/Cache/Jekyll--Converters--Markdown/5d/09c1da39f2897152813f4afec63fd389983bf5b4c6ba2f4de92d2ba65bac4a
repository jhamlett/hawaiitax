I"/<p>Matt Delaney, president of HiAccounting and the Hawaii Group, said his firm has been fielding an increased amount of calls from individuals to businesses, seeking information regarding the new GOP tax reform bill. Delaney, who said his firm has been “gearing up” for tax season since it acquired Oahu-based WR Consulting Inc. in July, is looking to grow the firm’s staff, as the workload increases as a result of the new tax laws. On Friday, President Donald Trump signed a $1.5 trillion tax reform package that includes lowering the tax rate for corporations and individuals and doubling the child tax credit, among others. “From tax preparers to managers, we’re trying to hire at all levels because of the new workload that we see coming down the pipeline,” Delaney told Pacific Business News.</p>
